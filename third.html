  I have a white coloured, soft and furry pet cat. It is a Himalayan Cat. These
  cats are known for their soft furry coats and that is what attracted me too.
  Since I am a single child,<small>my parents decided </small> my parents
  decided to get me a pet. They asked me if I wanted a dog or a cat and I
  instantly chose the latter. <em>My father</em> took me to a pet shop and my
  heart went pounding for this cute little white kitten with grey ears. We
  brought it home and since then it has been my best friend. I have named it
  Rosie. Rosie is there with us since the last two years and has become a part
  of our family. I love playing with it. I play with it in the house and also
  take it out in the park every evening. I bathe it twice a month with the help
  of my mother. Bathing sessions are super fun for me as well as Rosie. My
  mother makes it a point to comb Rosieâ€™s furry coat every day. We have a
  separate set of combs, brushes, shampoo and soaps for Rosie. We also take good
  care of her diet. We bring home special cat food for her. I love my pet cat.
